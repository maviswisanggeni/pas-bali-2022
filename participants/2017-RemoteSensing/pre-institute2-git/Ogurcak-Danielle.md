## Bio

I am a post-doctoral associate at Florida International University in Miami, FL. I have a degree in Earth Systems Science and I study how vegetation changes over time and space. Specifically, I use remote sensing techniques and field sampling to understand the impacts to coastal forests from anthropogenic activities and disturbance events like hurricanes. I am currently studying how sea level rise and water management decisions have affected mangrove ecosystems in south Florida and Puerto Rico. I work in the Atlantic Neotropical domain.

My goals for the NEON Data Institute are to increase my knowledge of using Python to work with large spatial datasets and to improve my version control.

## Capstone Project

I am interested in analyzing hyperspectral data from NEON's AOP for two sites within the Southeast Domain. I would like to investigate relationships between leaf spectral reflectance and plant species cover, structure, and leaf chemistry.

Data for the project will include LiDAR and hyperspectral data from the May 2014 flights over the **Ordway-Swisher Biological Station (OSBS)** and **Disney Wilderness Preserve (DSNY)** in central and north Florida. Plant species cover was assessed in May to July 2014 and herb clip harvests were acquired for both sites in July 2014. While both sites have longleaf pine overstories, they occur in different watersheds and any available data on soil properties, moisture, and meteorological variables could be used to characterize differences.
