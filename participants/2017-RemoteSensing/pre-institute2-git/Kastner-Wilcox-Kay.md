## Bio
I am Kay Kastner-Wilcox and I am a PhD Candidate in Soil and Water Sciences at the
University of Florida.  My research focuses on the human dimension of natural resources
and more specifically on individuals’ perception and knowledge of soil and its
degradation in conjunction with the assessment of the anthropogenic causes of soil degradation.
My goal for the NEON course is to gain a greater understanding of remote sensing data and to learn
to use it to determine land use and soil sealing along an urban – rural gradient.

## Capstone Project
I propose an assessment of the degree of impervious surfaces that exist along an
urban – rural gradient that would require satellite images (e.g., Spot or Landsat),
LiDAR data to assess vegetation, bare ground and man-made objects.
(e.g., NEON Ecosystem Structure) and aerial photography (various options).
