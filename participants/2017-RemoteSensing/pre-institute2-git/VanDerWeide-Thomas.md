## Introduction

### Thomas Van Der Weide

Hello!
My name is Thomas and I will be starting as a geophysics graduate student at Boise State University in June.
I'm not yet familiar with the project I will be working on but know that it will involve detecting
peak Alfalfa crop seed bloom using hyperspectral data.
I think remote sensing technology can be a *very* powerful tool for understanding our environment
and am looking forward to learning how to better manage, document, and analyze data while creating a reproducible workflow.

## Capstone Project
I would like to use hyperspectral data to compare vegetation stages and use various vegetation indexes to estimate these
vegetation states over time.
