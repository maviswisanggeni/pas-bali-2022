# Maggi Kelly Bio

# Information
## Name 
My name is Maggi Kelly
## Domain of Interest
I am interested in a range of mapping techniques - remote sensing, object-based image analysis, 
geospatial modeling, lidar analysis, participatory mapping, web visualization, and field-based monitoring 
- to answer applied questions about how and why California landscapes are changing, and what that means for 
the people who live on, derive sustenance from, and manage them. I am starting to collectively call this work 
"Spatial Data Science" and am interested in all the challenges associated with broad data fusion for 
geospatial analysis. 
## Goal for the course
I have a few goals for the coarse: one is to learn an open workflow for remote sensing; another is to learn 
how you all run such a complicated workshop.
## Capstone Project
I am still thinking about this - I cant be there Friday and Saturday, so I might jump on another group project.
For now, I have some drone imagery of ag fields that I want to work on extracting individual trees from.
