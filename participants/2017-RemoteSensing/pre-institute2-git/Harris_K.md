## Kendall Harris

Hello! My name is Kendall, and I am a field tech with NEON at the
Desert Southwest domain (D14) in Tucson, Arizona.  I work primarily with
the small mammal, insect and soil protocols at NEON but I am very
interested in working with Remote Sensing data.  I received my bachelors in
biochemistry and am looking forward to grad school where I hope to work with
remote sensing data to monitor wetland habitat health and habitat loss.
Goals I have for this course are to improve my coding skills, and learn how to
work with NEONs lidar and Hyperspectral imagery data.  

## Proposed Capstone Project

As this is the first opportunity I have had to actually work with remote
sensing data, I would like to try a simple project comparing changes in canopy
health and height between two collection dates.  This would allow me to see
die-off occurring in the ecosystem from invasive species.
