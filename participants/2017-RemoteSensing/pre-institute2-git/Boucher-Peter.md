***It's nice to meet you!***

I am an Environmental Science PhD Student from UMass Boston who studies lasers, trees,
ecological disturbance, and a bit of environmental history. My background is
actually in the humanities (I was an english major!), and I jumped back into the
sciences after an experience writing for an environmental newspaper and
teaching math at an elementary school in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.

Now, I work with forest ecologists at Harvard Forest and remote sensing scientists
to monitor how New England forests are changing as a result of an invasive insect,
the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA or **Adelges tsugae**), and climate change. 

My main goal for the Data Institute is to set up a workflow that allows me to process
airborne lidar data to characterize progressive changes occuring in an infested
New England forest (NEON Domain 1: Harvard Forest in central MA). I want to learn best practices
for writing and sharing code. In addition, I'd like to learn more about how NEON processes
their airborne lidar data from waveform into discrete lidar data. 

## Proposed Capstone Project

I aim to create canopy structure and understory models (understory presence/absence and canopy height at 0-10m)
using first discrete and then full waveform NEON lidar data to document new growth at Harvard Forest,
a NEON core site in Petersham, MA. I plan to document a time series of understory growth over
the Smithsonian Institute ForestGEO 35 ha plot, maintained since 2010. By documenting
this new understory growth, I plan to characterize the forestâ€™s response
to an invasive insect infestation (HWA) that has been killing off eastern hemlock trees
(**Tsuga canadensis**) in the ForestGEO plot since 2008. As hemlocks trees loose needles and branches and
eventually collapse in the coming decade, we will see a transition of forest composition from evergreen hemlock
to deciduous hardwoods (mainly black birch).

AOP discrete lidar data (NEON in 2014 and 2016; NASA GliHT in 2012) provide an exciting opportunity
to monitor the progressive change in forest structure in this region. This historical shift in forest composition
exemplifies a change that is occurring all across the east coast, as climate change warms winters
and pushes the habitable range of HWA further northward each year.
