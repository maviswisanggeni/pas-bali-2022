## Bio

My name is Ed Gage and I work at Colorado State University as a research scientist in the Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship, Warner College of Natural Resources. My research interests are varied and I've tried wearing a variety of hats over my career, some better fitting than others. My early training was in forest ecology, with an emphasis on forest inventory and health assessment. After moving to Colorado, I began working in wetlands and riparian ecosystems, which remain a focus of much of my present work. For my Ph.D., I shifted gears from the wildland to urban context, focusing on the ecohydrology of irrigated urban vegetation in the Colorado Front Range.  
 
## Proposed captstone project

I’m interested in using **NEON AOP data** (LiDAR and possibly hyperspectral) collected for Boulder, CO (Southern Rockies & Colorado Plateau Domainin) in 2013 to evaluate the composition and structure of urban forests in the acquisition area. 

## Goals for data institute

1. Develop techniques and reproducible workflows for processing lidar data to discriminate different land cover classes and quantify structure (e.g. tree height).

2. Develop techniques and reproducible workflows for processing multispectral data and for using such data to characterize land cover composition and properties.
