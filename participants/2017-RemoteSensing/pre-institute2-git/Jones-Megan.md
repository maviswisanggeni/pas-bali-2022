## Megan A. Jones

Hello, I am a facilitator of the **2017 NEON Data Institute**. I am a 
scientist, with a background in avian biology & evolutionary behavioral ecology, 
and a science educator. 

At NEON, I get to work on a variety of our educational initiatives including:

* our scientist-focused Data Skills content
  + workshops at various conferences, 
  + self-paced tutorials on the [neondataskills.org](www.neondataskills.org) website, and 
  + these Data Institutes;
* our undergraduate focused data skills & ecological concept content, and  
* our undergraduate summer internship program hosted at NEON headquarters. 


## Proposed Capstone Project

Each participant should include a section that outlines their possible capstone 
project and the data that is needed to address their questions.
