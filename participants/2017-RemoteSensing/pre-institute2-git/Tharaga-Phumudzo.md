#Tharaga PC Bio
*I am an Agrometeorologist from The University of The Free State* in South Africa.** My research Interest are in Irrigation Science, Flux Measurements and Climate Change**
I have a Masters Degree In Agrometeorology and Currently Studying Towards('PHD- Agrometeorology')
## Goals at the Institute
('I would like to learn more about the applications of remote sensing on Evepotransiration measurements and remote sensing data analysis')
It will be a great opportunity for me to learn more about NEON and how to access **Data** from its hubs

### Capstone Project 
** Measurement of Evapotranspitation rates at BART Using Remote Sensing**
I would like to use the Data from the Station which will be the papremters of the **PenMan Monteith Equation**
This Project will require the use of Python and R to calculate the parameters such as ('ETO,ETC and ET')
Looking forward to meet the team on Experts in Remote Sensing and to learn More about NEON
