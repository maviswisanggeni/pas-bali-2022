 I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department. I just moved to Boulder in August, and prior to that I've lived in MN, WI, MT, CA, and UT working in different ecology jobs. I am broadly interested in **urban ecology** and how climate change and urban development affect plant activity at different spatial and temporal scales. My research is focused on tracking intra-urban variation in *plant phenology in Colorado.* Right now I am recording ground measurements of seasonal activity of riparian plants and their microclimates along Boulder Creek. I hope to use remote sensing imagery [digital photos, LandSat, and MODIS] to gather more information about land surface phenology and compare with ground observations in order to make estimates for larger land areas.

 One major goal for this course is to get *practice organizing, processing, and comparing multiple types of remote sensed imagery for a single area* such as **digital PhenoCam photos, LandSat, MODIS, and Hyperspectral imagery.**


## Capstone Project
***
For the capstone project, I am interested in comparing ground phenological observations, phenoCam photos, AOP NDVI, and surface temperature from NEON sites in Colorado to the larger spatial and greater temporal resolution of the MODIS and LANDSAT satellites. I hope to get a better sense of how well continental scale imagery may represent the finer scale data collected from D10 Central Plains and D13 Rocky Mountains NEON sites. This project would address *1)* what is the variability (or consensus) with the **phenology** (start of spring) in 2017 among the imagery types (phenoCam, LandSat, MODIS) and ground observations for D10 and D13?  and *2)* what is the variability (or consensus) for **surface temperature** estimates among ground/tower, LandSat, and MODIS sensors?

These exploratory questions will be suitable for collaboration since they involve several data sets, however given the short nature of work time, the scope could easily be trimmed.
