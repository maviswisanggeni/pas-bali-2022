# Introduction

My name is Christine Swanson. I'm a PhD student at the University of Florida School of Forest Resources and Conservation. I am researching the impacts of dams on riparian forests in the Amazon. I have a Master's in Biology from the University of Central Florida. For my Master's I worked at NEON's Ordway-Swisher Biological Station studying the relationship between bats and forest structure. My main goal for taking this course is to learn how to make remote sensing studies better reproducible. I would also like to learn how to quantify lidar data with Python. My domain of interest is forestry/ecology/conservation biology.

## Capstone Project

For the capstone project, I would like to extend a project I am currently working on to the continental United States. I am presenting the effects of scaling on LiDAR interpretation in neotropical forests at the Ecological Society of America. I would like to do a comparative study at the different NEON field sites using data from NEON's AOP. Using these data, I can look at whether different forest cover types scale differently.
