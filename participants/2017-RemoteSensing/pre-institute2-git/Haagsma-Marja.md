Hi! I'm a first year PhD student at Oregon State University in the Water Resources Engineering programm. I work with hyperspectral data (from ground measurements or UAV, Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle, based).

## Goals
Learning more about using hyperspectral data

## Capstone Project
Working with the hyperspectral data in combination with environmental variables. 

### Data
- HS data, or derived from HS (e.g. Solar Induced Fluorescence approximation)
- Environmental variables (e.g. GPP)
