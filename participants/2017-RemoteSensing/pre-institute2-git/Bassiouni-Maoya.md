## Maoya Bassiouni

Hello, I am a PhD student at Oregon State University in the Water Resources Engineering program. 

### Goals
* Become a better collaborator
* Discover NEON data products & how to process and use them
* Get inspiration for future projects using NEON data


### Proposed Capstone Project

#### Summary
Explore simple scaling relations between topographic indices and available vegetation indices/characteristics available in the NEON airborne remote sensing products. Repeat at multiple sites and compare scaling relations.


*NEON AOP Data*

* Topography
	+ elevation
	+ slope
	+ aspect

* Ecosystem structure and vegetation type: 
	+ biomass
	+ canopy height
	+ LAI
	+ classified point clouds

* Vegetation indices
	+ NDVI
	+ EVI
	+ ARVI
	+ Xanthophyll
	+ Lignin
	+ fPAR
