Hello everyone! I am a Research Assistant for the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS), at the Theoretical and Experimental Ecology Station based in Moulis, France. I have worked on a variety of research projects in Ecology, using organisms such as reptiles, amphibians and birds as models to study applied and fundamental research questions. For my last project, I was able to work remotely from Colorado, where I am now based out of.

I am taking this course because I am interested in learning new techniques and skills that will broaden my area of expertise. I find remote sensing technology applied to ecological questions to be both fascinating and very powerful, and I want to learn about it!

## My Capstone Project

I would like use NEON remote sensing data and try to characterize hyperspectral imaging data using pattern recognition.
