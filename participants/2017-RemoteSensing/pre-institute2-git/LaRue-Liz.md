## Liz LaRue


I'm a plant evolutionary ecologist and I'm finishing up my PhD at **Purdue University**. My dissertation is on dispersal trait variation in a Great Lakes beach plant and the potential consequences for geographic range limits under climate change. 
	
I'll be starting a post-doc in Brady Hardiman's lab at Purdue in August, where I'll be looking at how how forest structure ecosystem processes using.


## Capstone Project

Idea: Identification of the presence of invasive plant species in forests using aerial LiDAR

Rational: To learn how to use AOP data to map the distribution of vegetation.

Types of NEON data needed:
AOP data from forested NEON sites
Plant community presence and abundance data from the same sites
