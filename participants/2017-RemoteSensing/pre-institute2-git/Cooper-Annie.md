### Annie Cooper

I am a 5th year PhD student at the University of Montana in the Global
Ecology and Climate Lab. My dissertation research focuses on how natural 
disturbances impact climate at local and regional scales across western 
North America. I am particularly interested in the spatial heterogeneity 
of impacts across and within ecosystems. Past and current research
topics have included: the impacts of fires and bark beetles on surface 
temperatures and primary productivity, determining climate controls of 
differences in growth between beetle-killed and surviving trees following 
a severe outbreak of mountain pine beetle in west-central Montana, and 
developing a workflow to automate the identification and attribution 
of forest disturbances using Landsat data. 

During this course, I hope to learn better practices for code 
documentation and project organization, and improve my knowledge of Python.

## Capstone project

My current work uses satellite data products (e.g., MODIS and Landsat
derived products) to determine the location, type, and impacts of forest 
disturbance. The accuracy of this work would improve dramatically by linking
satellite-detected changes in forest canopies and climate with field or
near-ground observations. I would like to develop a workflow for 
determining changes in biomass, canopy structure,and canopy composition 
over time using LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery from a forested NEON site.
