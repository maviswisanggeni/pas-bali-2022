## Bio

I am a professor at Alabama A&M University in the Department of Biological and Environmental Science. I teach remote sensing and GIS related courses. My main research focus is on land-use land-cover change detection and modeling; environmental quality assessment using remote sensing, Lidar and GIS techniques. Other research interests include modeling of the impacts of climate change on agricultural and forest ecosystems, 

My goal for the 2017 NEON Data Institute is to increase my knowledge in using hyperspectral, Lidar data and Python programming. 

My domain interest is Alabama, D08, Ozarks Complex.

## Capstone Project
I am interested in using hyperspectral and Lidar to measure individual tree heights for selected stands within the Bankhead National Forest and validate with actual measurement done at the site.
