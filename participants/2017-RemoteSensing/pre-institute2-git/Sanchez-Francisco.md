## Bio
Hi everyone. I’m Fran, a computer scientist at University of Granada (Spain) who’s been involved in environmental monitoring projects since 2012, when I performed a scientific and technical cooperative work at the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). I also worked at Doñana Biological Station of the Spanish Council for Scientific Research (http://icts.ebd.csic.es), where a wireless sensor network composed by Flux Towers and a wide variety of environmental sensors was deployed at Doñana National Park (Spain). Since 2016 I am working at Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory (LTER-platform) where remote sensing and wireless sensor networks are used to assess the impacts of climate change in this mountain range. Our Sensor Observation Service is accessible via http://wsncentral.iecolab.es . At both sites, I've been involved in wireless sensor network projects always concerned about impacts of human activities at different scales, and specifically on how to measure, collect, analyze and then integrate environmental data into the proper information and knowledge management systems.

## Goals
My personal goals for participating in NEON's Data Institute is to learn from your experience in order to develop critical skills which allow me to:
* Implement your expertise and work philosophy at Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory (LTER-site)
* Learn about hyperspectral and LiDAR data as well as their potential use to assess the impact of global change in Mediterranean ecosystems.
* Use site-based monitoring as ground truth to assess the performance of remote sensing products.

## Capstone Project
As far as Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory is a LTER-platform located at a Mediterranean climate area in Spain, I’d like to propose a capstone project which covers: By one hand common ecological problems between our biogeographical area and NEON sites located in the Mediterranean domain of US. By other hand get a better understanding of both data portals in order to establish links between both institutions.

Regarding to the ecological problem, the thematic rationale underlying this proposal is to understand the relationships between abiotic factors (temperature, moisture, etc…), the biological variables (PAR, etc... ) and the ecosystem functioning / structure in a global change scenario. For this purpose, at Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory more than 100 sensors (composed by soil temperature, soil moisture, surface temperature, air temperature and relative humidity) coupled with PAR sensors are being deployed at Quercus pyrenaica forest located in this mountain area. **How would be possible to achieve this question in a NEON site located in the Mediterranean domain of US?** In order to answer this question, I’d like to make use of the following NEON Data Sources:
#### Flux tower measurements
* Soil Measurements
* Heat flux
* Soil temperature
* Soil moisture
* CO2 concentration

#### Microclimate
* Surface temperature
* Air Temperature
* Relative Humidity
* PAR

In the same way, NDVI cameras are being deployed at the previous mentioned Quercus pyrenaica forest in order to detect forest change over time and also to get forest health . For this reason, I’d like to make use of the following NEON Data Sources:
#### Hyperspectral Remote Sensing (including vegetation cover)
* NDVI
* EVI
#### LiDAR (to detect changes in vegetation structure over time/space)
* Topography

By last, regarding to get a better understanding of both data portals (NEON http://data.neonscience.org  and iEcolab http://wsncentral.iecolab.es based on 52º North) it’d be interesting to learn the base of NEON’s API in order to find relations between it and our Sensor Observation Service, based on 52º North (Initiative for Geospatial Open Source Software by OGC)
