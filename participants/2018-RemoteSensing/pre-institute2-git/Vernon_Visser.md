## Vernon Visser

I am an ecologist working in a stats department in Cape Town, South Africa (although I don't really claim to be a statistician!). I am interested in many aspects of biogeography, including understanding the drivers of plant distributions and productivity. My major interest in attending this course is to develop better skills in the use and analysis of hyperspectral imagery, which I would ultimately like to use for detecting C3 and C4 grasses (through differences in phenology) and monitor their productivity over time in relation to climate.

## Capstone project
Give the time constraints for this project, I am proposing a relatively simple investigation of the relationships between NEON remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), satellite-derived NDVI (e.g. Landsat 8), and NEON field measurements of plant productivity and cover.

Although the relationship between NDVI and plant productivity is fairly well established, the unique combination of high spatial resolution remotely sensed VI data, plant production data (herbaceous biomass), and plant cover data that NEON provides will allow us to interrogate in much greater detail the relative contribution that specific plants / plant functional types (such as grasses) contribute to broader scale patterns of plant productivity (as measured using coarser resolution satellites, such as Landsat 8).

Data requirements:
- Landsat 8 NDVI (time matched to herbaceous biomass harvest date)
- NEON NDVI
- NEON herbaceous biomass
- NEON plant percent cover
