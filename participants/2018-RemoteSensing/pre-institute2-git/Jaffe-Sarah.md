Hello, I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Environmental Studies Program at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I have a background in primatology, however, I am trying to find interesting ways to transfer my skills and develop more sophisticated spatiotemporal methodologies that will support human-wildlife conflict management in the U.S.  I am currently interested in the changing migratory patterns of elk from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. 

I am thrilled to be participating in this year's NEON Data Workshop to learn the tricks of the trade for creating reproducible workflows using remote sensing, especially using Python.

For the purposes of this workshop, I would like to look at landscape scale changes in vegetation across time; this could be in the form of land cover and/or NDVI.  I am interested in both the Front Range (here) and in Eastern Oregon (which is most similar to NEON's Utah site), but with reproducible code, it could really be anywhere.  I am most curious how to incorporate NEON's hyperspectral imaging data and, should there be time, compare it to Landsat images.
