Hello! I am currently a master's student at Duke University studying water resource management. My undergraduate degree was in Earth Science, so I hope to use my background in science to inform management decisions. In particular, I am interested in the use of geospatial analysis and remote sensing to examine issues of water quality and quantity. My favorite watersheds are those dominated by the presence of snow and glaciers! My goal for this course is to learn more about the art of reproducible science and about new ways to incorporate lidar into my research.

## Capstone Project

I am interested in the interaction between vegetation and snowpack. Snowmelt is a large component in the water budget of many watersheds, and its behavior is often related to various measures of forest canopy structure, such as leaf area index and canopy openness. For my project, I would like to use data from the Teakettle Experimental Watershed. NEON AOP data from 2013 and 2017 will be useful. An additional dataset could be a 2010 snow-on and snow-off lidar flight campaign at the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory.
