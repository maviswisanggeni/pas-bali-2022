## Bio
I am a Ph.D. student in *Geomatics* at the **University of Florida** and I am taking this course to broaden my LiDAR/hyperspectral skills and science based principles that are critical to my Ph.D. and are transportable and could be utilized for post graduate career as a research scientist or an academic educator.

## Capstone

**Project Idea:**  
Classification of Land Cover maps using hyperspectral data and estimation of Biomass using LiDAR data.  Also determine the correlation between Greenness/Soil Moisture/Biomass

**Types of NEON data needed:**
* Terrestrial Instrument System (TIS)
  +  Soil Moisture Measurements
* Airborne Observation Platform (AOP)
  * Hyperspectral imaging spectrometer
  * Full waveform and discrete return LiDAR
