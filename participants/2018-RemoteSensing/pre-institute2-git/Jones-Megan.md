## Megan A. Jones

Hello, I coordinate the **2018 NEON Data Institute**. I am a 
scientist, with a background in avian biology & evolutionary behavioral ecology, 
and a science educator. 

At NEON, I get to work on a variety of our educational initiatives including:

* our researcher focused Data Skills content
  + workshops at various conferences, 
  + self-paced tutorials on the [neondataskills.org](www.neondataskills.org) website, and 
  + these Data Institutes;
* our undergraduate focused data skills & ecological concept content including a
[Faculty mentoring network](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/neon2018). 


## Proposed Capstone Project

Each participant should include a section that outlines their possible capstone 
project and the data that is needed to address their questions.
