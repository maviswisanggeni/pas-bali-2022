## Christopher Kilner
I am finishing up my first year at Duke, pursuing a PhD in Ecology under the guidance of Jim Clark. Last year, I earned a Masters in Biodiversity and Conservation from Trinity College Dublin, *Ireland*!

I am interested in landscape scale changes to ecological systems and leveraging the unique opportunity that remote sensing provides to this field of inquiry. I hope to utilize NEON's network and AOP data to answer questions regarding climate change, community composition, and global change in North America through a Bayesian framework.

One goal for this data institute is to familiarize myself with the most efficient means of processing the vast amount of AOP and biological information available, and to create an open-source workflow to assist my lab in our current NASA funded NEON project **Grant:AIST-16-0052**.

## Capstone Project
Currently, the NASA funded project requires a fusion of NEON and non-NEON data sources. One such source is 25 years' worth of seed trap data collected at Harvard Forest. For my project, I hope to identify *Quercus sp.* (Oaks) using hyperspectral data and compare the distribution and clustering of these oaks to the seed-trap data.

This project will serve two purposes:
+To test whether individual species can be identified from the Hyperspecral Data and,

+Compare the clustering of trees with seed trap data to understand the seed fall range of *Quercus* at the Harvard Forest Site.

To accomplish this, I will need the 2015, 2016, or 2017 raw hyperspectral data from NEON and my lab's tree-plot and seed-rain information.
