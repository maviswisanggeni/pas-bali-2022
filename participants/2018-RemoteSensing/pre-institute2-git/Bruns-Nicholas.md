Hello!

I'm finishing my first year of a PhD in river ecology at Duke, advised by an aquatic ecosystem ecologist (Jim Heffernan) and a fluvial geomorphologist (Martin Doyle). I'm new to ecology, have a masters in computer science, and in my last life worked as a data scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology on machine learning algorithms for [continent scale avian distribution estimates](https://ebird.org/science/modeling/) using citizen gathered data.

I'm broadly interested in how landscape structure shapes ecological processes. Right now I'm thinking about how ecological processes change in water parcels as they travel down whole river networks and encounter shifting physical conditions. I'm using downstream gradients of phytoplankton abundance as my study system. I also really like theory based math models. At a dissertation scale, I hope to brew up math models which I'll confront with remotely measured data.



## Proposed Capstone Project
Ideally, I'd like to retrieve from the AOP hyperspectral imagery downstream Chlorophyll A (Chl-a) concentrations at NEON aquatic sites. Satellite imagery (eg Landsat, Sentinel) has long been operationalized for Chl-a retrieval in oceans, but the spatial and spectral resolutions are too coarse for retrieval in rivers with their relative narrowness and optical complexity.

As a primary objective, I'd like to inventory available in-situ phytoplankton measurements (water column Chl-a, from both grab samples and the continuous sensors) during AOP flights across NEON aquatic sites. Might some sites have better available data than others? Is an approach that pools training data across sites and flights required?


As a secondary goal, (pending time, findings in objective 1, and mastery of workshop material), I'd like to make a first attempt at Chl-a retrieval at a best suited site. Post workshop, after achieving sufficient retrieval performance, I would like to inventory other available flight-time in-situ NEON data that can be linked to these retrieved gradients and used as parameters in a process model I've developed. I'm particularly interested in the NEON zooplankton, light, discharge, nutrient, and temperature information. I'm also interested in channel morphology measurements, which do not require correspondence with flight times.
