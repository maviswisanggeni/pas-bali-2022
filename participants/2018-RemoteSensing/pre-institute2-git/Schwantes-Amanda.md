I’m currently a postdoc at Duke University working with  Jennifer Swenson and Jim Clark on a NASA funded project. Our main goal is to create a web-based tool that provides forecasts of species abundances in response to climate change. We’re using a joint species distribution model, biodiversity data from multiple agencies (including NEON), and remotely sensed data pre-processed using Google Earth Engine’s Python API.

I recently graduated from Duke University with a PhD in ecology. My dissertation explored improvements
1. in monitoring drought-induced tree mortality using remotely sensed imagery and
2. in forecasting how forests will respond to increases in droughts and heatwaves projected under climate change.

At the workshop, I'm looking forward to learning more about how to create automated workflows in python for processing Lidar data.

## Proposed Capstone Project

I think it would be interesting to test if  incorporating habitat structure (through Lidar) can improve our ability to model species-specific tick abundances, in particular the deer tick that spreads Lyme Disease. From a quick preliminary analysis looking at the **tick-borne pathogen status** dataset it seems like the HARV site had a high rate of Lyme Disease. Therefore we could use this site as a case-study and then expand to other sites time permitting.

General steps could include
* generating a variety of habitat structure metrics from Lidar,
* downloading/re-formatting the **Ticks sampled using drag cloths** dataset.
* downloading some additional environmental data (e.g., climate, elevation), which we could easily get from GEE.
