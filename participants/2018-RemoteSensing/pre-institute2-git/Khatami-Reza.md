***
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the **University of Florida**. My areas of research interest is **remote sensing**, **land cover mapping**, 
**map accuracy assessment**, and **environmental sampling**. I received my PhD from *SUNY-ESF* where I mainly focused on image classification and accuracy assessment. 

## Goal for the course 
I would like to learn more about the whole process of reproducible science so I can publish my code and data along with my papers.

## Capstone Project

**Project Idea:**  
Classification of Land Cover maps using hyperspectral data and estimation of Biomass using LiDAR data.  Also determine the correlation between Greenness/Soil Moisture/Biomass 

**Types of NEON data needed:** 
* Terrestrial Instrument System (TIS)
  +  Soil Moisture Measurements
* Airborne Observation Platform (AOP)
  * Hyperspectral imaging spectrometer
  * Full waveform and discrete return LiDAR
