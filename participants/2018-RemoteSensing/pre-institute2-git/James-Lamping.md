Hello, I am currently an undergraduate of Forestry attending Humboldt State University. I am working under Dr. Harold Zald at the Teakettle Experiremental Watershed (TEAK). My interests lie in the use of remote sensing in measuring and understanding our forested landscapes. 

One goal I have while attending NEONs Data Institute is to gain the ability to compare Lidar pointcloud datasets to structure from motion datasets obtained from sUAS. 


### Proposed Capstone Project

The utilization of sUAS to create useful datasets for forest applications has become an increasing interest in the study of ecology. As the technology continues to advance, new techniques are being developed to create cheap and relatively accurate datasets in comparison to data to that is collected from remote-sensing platforms such as satellites and manned aircraft. However, Structure from Motion (SfM) has yet to replicate the full range of data that is obtained from Lidar. 
I am currently working on a project that will be comparing the NEON lidar dataset to a SfM point cloud collected at the Teakettle Experimental watershed. The focus of the project is to determine if tree approximate objects and tree canopy volume can be calculated accurately and comparably to NEONs 2017 lidar data set. Data and resources that will be needed to accomplish this capstone:

•	NEON Lidar dataset from 2017 (subset to plot within the Teakettle watershed)
•	UAS images acquired from teakettle experimental watershed from 2018 (unprocessed)
•	Photoscan, Pix4D, or ESRI Dron2Map access to create a SfM pointcloud

There are known limitations for this capstone and I am only hoping for a proof-of-concept and a better understanding of how to compare the two datasets and produce usable products using python. One main limitation will be comparing Lidar from 2017 to data collected in 2018. Also, the sUAS photos I will be using for this capstone will only be shot with the image sensor facing directly downward to make processing and comparison quicker and simpler for this capstone. The overall project will be comparing your upcoming 2018 Lidar data to a much more complex sUAS dataset. I will be coming to the institute from the field and do not have the resources to process the sUAS photos on site. I am hoping that NEON will have a licensed computer that can help me process these images. 

(`Other participants are welcome to use the SfM data and joun this project, however, my goal is to complete this project individually.`)
