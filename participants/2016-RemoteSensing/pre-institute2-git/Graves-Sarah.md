## Personal Bio

My name is Sarah Graves. I am a PhD student in Forest Resources and Conservation at the University of Florida in Gainesville. My area of interest is forest ecology and dynamics, and how to understood processes at large scales via remote sensing.

One goal I have for the course is to build (or have the tools to build) a flexible workflow to extract hyperspectral and lidar data (from L1 or L3) NEON AOP products with spatially explicit data, such as plot locations. The flexibility aspect relates to an automated way to link the spatial area (ie, polygon shapefile) with the geographically relevant AOP file.


## Capstone Project

For my project, I want to explore the spectral variability of various plots within and across NEON sites. Specifically, I want to quantify how much spectral variability is related to characteristics of the plot or stand, including species composition and vegetation structure. In this process, I hope to understand or hypothesize about what other characteristics explain spectral variability. This project requires resolving some issues, like how to quantify spectral variability and how to separate species found in a plot to canopy and understory species (for forested plots).

I am interested in sites in Domain 3 (Southeast), Domain 8 (Ozarks Complex), and Domain  7 (Appalachians & Cumberland Plateau).

The data required for this project include:
* L1 hyperspectral
* L3 lidar
* plot information for **Plant presence and percent cover** plots (with spatially explicit point or polygon information)
* vegetation structure data (if it exists?)
