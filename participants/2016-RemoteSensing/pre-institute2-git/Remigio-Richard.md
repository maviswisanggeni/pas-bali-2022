# Hello, NEON DI16  World!  :sweat_smile:

## *Introduction to Richard (Rich) Remigio, An Unwritten Autobiography*
Hi everyone. I’m Rich and a current PhD student at Columbia University’s School of Public Health studying environmental health sciences. Prior to starting my doctoral studies, I worked as an environmental engineer for the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) working broadly on water quality protection at the national scale. My research interests relates to characterizing the impacts of observed extreme weather events, like heat, on vulnerable populations. I am also interested in understanding the ecologic role of improved land cover and physical infrastructure design in influencing population health. I’m pretty *green* to remote sensing but have a strong background in biostatistics and GIS/spatial analyses. My goal is to learn to harness geospatial data, like remote sensing, into epidemiological models to predict health impacts caused by climate and land cover change across time and space in urban and peri-urban regions.

### *Award-Winning Capstone Project Proposal*

*Apply an eco-epidemiological framework to determine the role of land cover and temperature on ecosystem health at selected NEON eco-region study sites*
An overarching interest for a project is in understanding the role of land cover and land cover changes in regulating heat fluxes. Ultimately, estimating its effect on surface and air temperature in selected regions. Prior studies have considered and observed the phenomena of urban heat island effects in peri-urban and urban regions. These land cover types has undergone dramatic land cover change especially with increased imperviousness and reduction of contiguous green spaces. It would be interesting to determine the extent of land cover changes in the natural environment and also determine whether similar phenomena of heat island effects, or microclimate formation, can occur. If any should exist, is it possible to identify mechanistic markers of microclimate heat islands and characterize its mechanistic effect on ecosystem health markers in selected eco-regions?
By using an eco-epidemiological framework, we could consider a hierarchical modeling approach to take advantage of measurements taken at site-specific locations over time (e.g. longitudinal study design, continuous and repeated measurements). This is a great opportunity to determine causality by taking advantage of both in-situ and remote sensing data that represent changes in temperature, due to changes in land cover heterogeneity, and determine its impacts on the natural environment.  A major exercise that I’d like to learn and to apply is to operationalize environmental data collected by remote sensing for epidemiological models.

A potential proposal is to characterize land cover and temperature at selected eco-regions that could represent varying levels of vulnerability due to climate change (e.g. Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Tanga, etc. might be considered highly vulnerable eco-regions of interest). There are varying epidemiological designs that can be applied and tested. For example, time series analysis if we choose to look at year-round temperature data and its relationship to changes or shifts in land cover, and ultimately on ecosystem health. Or using case-crossover to study pre-defined heat-wave events and matching non-heat wave events in relationship to land cover and ecosystem health.  Given the enormity of the data universe, biogeochemical processes are not being addressed however will likely be a crucial theme and a critical need for workshop peer collaborators.
