#Dave McCaffrey - Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada

**Interests:
Years ago, my initial research interests were in behavioral ecology. Eventually I *migrated* into the
world of remote sensing and hydrology. 

**Goal for Course:
THIS! *Versioning* scripts! I have cringe-worthy folders full multiple script edits. No more!

##Capstone Project:
A project on mosquito habitat and disease transmission could make good use of NEON's diverse datasets. I am currently 
working on a project which classifies prairie wetlands using synthetic apperature radar and airborne lidar, but there 
is a big push on for hyperspectral wetland classfication. I would be curious to try with NEON's AOP data. Addtionaly,
the mosquito pathogen status data (only saw for D03 on quick inspection), and ecohydrology data would be useful.
