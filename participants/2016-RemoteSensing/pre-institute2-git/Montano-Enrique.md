## About Me

I recently received my PhD from the **University of Maryland** in *Geographical Sciences* with an emphasis on remote sensing.  I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the USGS in Reston, VA.  I love working on code and solving problems, so I'm excited about the workshop. I'm always looking for new ways to approach coding, and a workshop like **NEON** is a great opportunity to develop some new skills.

Most of my graduate work involved coarse-scale imagers (MODIS and VIIRS).  I'm interested in learning skills for accessing and processing hyperspectral data for applications in identifying invasive species.  I'm also interested in learning techniques for using LiDAR data.

## Capstone Project
Monitoring invasive species in various ecosystems is an stated priority for **NEON**.

Science questions:
* Is it possible to identify individual invasive tree (or other vegetation) species using data from AOP observations?  
* What combination of spectral bands offers separability?
* Does canopy structure from LiDAR add to the potential for identification?

AOP hyperspectral data is a fundamental component to this research.  The narrow, high-spectral resolution bands, fine spatial resolution, and spatial footprint allow exploration of this question.  LiDAR is potentially additive for examining separability from canopy structure.  Site surveys and inventories provide information for validation and calibration of models where species of interest are known to occur.  Finally, the relationship between soil nutrient availability and species occurrence might offer some insight to the identification.

I know this is too much for a workshop capstone project, but these are the questions driving the concept that I hope to work on while I'm in CO.
