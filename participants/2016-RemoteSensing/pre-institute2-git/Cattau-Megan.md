I am a **forest and landscape ecologist** who explores how anthropogenic factors affect disturbance dynamics in order to inform **conservation and land management** decisions. 
## Interests
### Peat-swamp ecology in Indonesia 
I have just finished a PhD at Columbia University in Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. In my PhD, I used remote sensing, fieldwork, and modeling to research forest dynamics in tropical peat-swamp forest in Indonesia. I investigated fire disturbance from the framework of coupled human and natural systems, evaluating the social-ecological drivers of fire probability and ignition sources and exploring the potential for the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification to reduce fire activity. I also examined the determinants of the trajectory of forest regrowth in post-burn areas and assessed the impacts of forest fragmentation and loss on Bornean oranguatan population density and distribution.

### Forest health in Colorado
I have just joined the University of Colorado Department of Geography and the Earth Lab to examine forest health and analyze what is driving Colorado forest dieback. IÕll be integrating datasets on canopy structure and loss, drought, beetle kill, fire dynamics, and field-based surveys of forest structure to identify convergence and divergence of disturbance events, cross-scale interactions, and consequent ecosystem response. In addition, she will use these data sources to guide targeted observations of forest properties detected from a suite of sensors on unmanned aerial systems (drones). 

## Goal(s) for Course
One main goal for this course is to learn how to work with Lidar data. I have been exclusively using data from passive sensors in my work, and I am thrilled to explore the possibilities of working with data from active sensors.
I would also like to get more organized with my workflows! 

## Capstone Project
I am interested in characterizing the structure of vegetative regrowth after fire disturbance. For this objective, I would use the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) data, combined with fire hotspot locations derived from MODIS. For the study area, I would use one of the sites for which LiDAR data is available (e.g., D03). 
Another option if this proves to be too complicated would be to characterize the structural habitat requirements of a species of interest. I would use climate data (Worldclim) as AOP data as predictors sampled at species occurrence points from GBIF in a species distribution model (Bioclim, GLM, or Maxent).
