## Megan A. Jones

Hello, I am a facilitator of the **2016 NEON Data Institute**. I am both a 
scientist, with a background in evolutionary behavioral ecology, and a science 
educator. 

At NEON, I get to work on a variety of our educational initiatives 
including 

* our scientist-focused Data Science content
  + workshops at various conferences, 
  + self-paced tutorials on the neondataskills.org website, and 
  + this Data Institute;
* our K-12 & informal educator focused Citizen Science Academy 
  + with a new course on using data in the classroom and
* our undergraduate summer internship program hosted at NEON headquarters. 


## Proposed Capstone Project

Each participant should include a section that outlines their possible capstone 
project and the data that is needed to address their questions.
