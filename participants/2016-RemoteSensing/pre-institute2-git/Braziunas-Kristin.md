## Bio

I am an incoming MS/PhD Student (starting this fall) studying landscape ecology at the 
University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison (Dept of Zoology), where I started working in January 2016 
as a Research Specialist in Forest Simulation Modeling. Over the course of my graduate 
studies, I hope to contribute to research on the impacts of changing climate and fire 
regimes on forest ecosystems, as well as how these impacts might change the way we 
approach forest and fire management. I am particularly interested in using multiple 
computational models and quantitative analyses to simulate forest development under novel 
environmental conditions at different spatial and temporal scales. Currently, I am 
parameterizing and testing the process-based model iLand for subalpine conifer forests in 
Yellowstone.

## Goals

* Learn more about the data that NEON will collect and disseminate
* Use remote sensing data to characterize forest structure and composition
* Refine existing and develop new skills in coding and data analysis

## Capstone Project

**Question: How well does remote sensing data represent forest structure and composition 
for initialization of a forest landscape simulation model?**

Distance-dependent, individual-tree, process-based forest landscape simulation models are 
needed to simulate potential forest growth and structure trajectories in a future 
characterized by novel environmental drivers (e.g. changing climate, disturbance frequency 
and severity). These models require detailed initialization files including information on 
forest structure, species composition, and individual tree characteristics. Collecting 
field data for model initialization is labor intensive at the plot scale, and unrealistic 
at the landscape scale. However, remote sensing of forest structure and species 
composition can potentially provide accurate and complete data at the landscape scale. I 
will first derive forest and individual tree structure and species composition from remote 
sensing data and compare it to stands in the same geographic region from the Forest 
Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. 

Time permitting, I will then use remote sensing data to create initialization files for 
the process-based model iLand, which requires the following information on individual 
trees and saplings: species, density, DBH, height, and age. When available, soil, climate, 
and atmospheric data (e.g. nutrient content in soils, CO2 concentration) will also be used 
for model initialization. 

Data needed:
* LiDAR (vegetation structure, heterogeneity, topography) 
* Hyperspectral (vegetation cover, species composition) 
* FIA data (condition, plot, and tree tables)

Data availability: Remote sensing data is available for sites in D01 (Northeast) and D03 
(Southeast). FIA data is available for all states via the FIA DataMart except Hawaii.
