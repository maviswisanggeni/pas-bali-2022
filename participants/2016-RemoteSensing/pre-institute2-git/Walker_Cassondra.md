##Name: Cassondra Walker

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Integrative Biology at Oklahoma State University.

## Interests:

I study how environmental conditions operate at different spatial scales (extent and grain) to constrain species distributions. I use remotely sensed data to quantify environmental conditions across differing spatial extents and resolutions.  I currently collect my own terrestrial LiDAR to quantify vertical structure at fine spatial scales. I am also interested in the scaling properties of LiDAR derived metrics; for example, how airborne collected point clouds can be modeled to terrestrial collected point clouds.

##Goals for the NEON course:

I am looking forward to learing how to work with remote sensing data in R.
I am also looking forward to learing the capabilites and limitations of working with NEON data.

##Capstone Project:

My project idea is to model Leaf Area Index at large spatial extents at varying resolutions.  I would like to develop a procedure to model the relationship between Leaf Area Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for the Great Plains (North, Central, and Southern Plains NEON Domains), where I conduct most of my research. Since LAI is not readily available at fine spatial resolutions, I would like to develop a procedure that will allow me to estimate LAI values from known NDVI values.  I believe that I will need to use a combination of NEON data as well as data from other sources to accomplish this.
