I'm a PhD student student, and my main research interest is modeling trace gas flux biogeochemistry in plant-soil interactions within the context of climate change. I'm also driven to create and enjoy listening to podcasts, cooking, and geocaching.

My *learning goals* for the NEON Institute are...

* Getting a better understanding of hyperspectral and LiDAR data
* Linking observational data with remote sensing products to reveal deep ecological insights
* Learning methods of collaborative and reproducible science with version control/documentation
* Making cool images

##Capstone Project

My *current project* involves identifying and describing, through both observations and modeling, areas affected by intermittent flooding events. I would like to use the course to develop a robust, reproducible workflow to identify areas across a landscape where ponding and flooding events have occurred or are likely to occur after intense precipitation. Some of the data I expect to be useful are:

* **Landsat 8** NIR and SWIR bands
* **gSSURGO** raster soil data
* **Boulder, CO pre- and post-flooding 2013** LiDAR and hyperspectral data
* **LiDAR** data of sites with poorly-drained soils
