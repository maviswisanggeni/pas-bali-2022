##Bio

Hi all! I am a 4th year PhD student in the Ecology Graduate Group at UC Davis. My research focuses on fire ecology of the shrublands (chaparral) of California. I'm interested in how these fire-prone and fire-adapted systems respond to the changes in fire frequency and magnitude that result from climate change and human activity. My work involves both plants (populations and communities) and people who live in fire-prone systems.

I am also involved in a citizen science project focused on phenology at a local reserve. The entire reserve burned in 2015, which has provided an opportunity for our citizen scientists to gather data that may help us understand the relationship between phenology and post-fire regeneration.

### Course Goals

My main goal is to learn to use remotely sensed data in order to look at vegetation regrowth following fire in order to see how regrowth varies with climate and other factors. I am also interested in learning to use remote sensing data to analyze other questions related to fire.

### Capstone Project Idea #1

**Question: How do climate variables affect post-fire regeneration of Western shrublands?**

**Background:** Climate change is expected to shape fire regimes and fire-prone ecosystems in a variety of ways. A recent paper found that a warmer climate enhances post-fire regeneration in South African shrublands (fynbos). I want to see whether other systems work the same way.

**Data needed:** hyperspectral data, LiDAR (?), forest structure, temp, precip, fire perimeters. Region TBD--ordinarily I would use California data but none appears to be available from NEON yet.

### Capstone Idea #2

**Question: Is there a relationship between phenology and fire? How does fire affect timing of flowering and leafing out post-fire?**

**Data needed:** phenology data, hyperspectral data (for fire severity and size?), fire perimeters.
