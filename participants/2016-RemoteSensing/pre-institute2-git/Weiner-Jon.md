#Jon Weiner

Hi everyone, my name is Jon and I'm a PhD student at the University of Nevada, Reno studying snow hydrology.
I'm interested in studying the interactions between snowpack and vegetation utilizing remote sensing tools such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).
My goal for this course is to learn how to use R and process remote sensing data.

## Capstone Project

Snowpack is one of the primary sources of water in the Western United States. Its abundance and distribution is moderated by vegetation, which can be measured at high resolutions using remote sensing tools such as LiDAR.

I propose to use LiDAR to study the leaf area index (LAI) or canopy coverage at different elevations with the goal of informing snow accumulation in those areas that have snowfall. I would use LiDAR datasets from Domain 17 from 2013 to do this analysis.
