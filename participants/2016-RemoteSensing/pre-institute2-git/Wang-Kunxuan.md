## Bio

Hi everyone, I am a masters student at the *University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign*. My research focuses on using waveform lidar data to describe vegetation structure such as biomass and forest canopy clumping. For future works, I hope to incorporate hyperspectural data into my research in hopes of describing forest and even row crops in greater detail. Therefore, one of my main goals for the **2016 NEON Data Institute** is to learn more about tools and data processing skills for working with hyperspectural data as well as lidar data.

## Capstone Project

For the project, I propose to use hyperspectural and waveform Lidar data to estimate tree-wise biomass for a forested site. First, Lidar data will be used to delineate individual trees. Then species information from hyperspectural data and all waveforms for each tree can be extracted. Structureal metrics of each waveform and tree species can be used as input to a learning algorithm with the biomass of each tree, derived from field sampling, acting as the response variable. In theory, hyperspectural data can provide tree type. lidar data can provide tree structure. The ultimate goal would be to use both types of information to estimate biomass with little to no field data for different sites.
