## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez. I study the effects of climatic variability on plant and insect function. In particular I study how plant functional traits influence Lepidoptera herbivores.

## Course Goals

I'm interested in strengthening skills for using hyperspectral data for identifying plant traits (including secondary compounds). I'm also interested in using LiDAR data for detecting spatio-temporal change in forest structure. 

## Capstone Project Idea

1. ___General questions___:
	1. Is it possible to identify functional groups (e.g. invasive, legume, or deciduous/evergreen species), and ultimately functional traits, using hyperspectral data?
	2. How do functional groups/traits change over time and space in tropical forests? 

2. ___Data required___:
	1. Hyperspectral data (to detect species and functional composition)
	2. Site surveys and inventories (to validate observations)
	3. LiDAR (to detect changes in vegetation structure over time/space)
	4. Climate data (as a potential driver of detected changes)
