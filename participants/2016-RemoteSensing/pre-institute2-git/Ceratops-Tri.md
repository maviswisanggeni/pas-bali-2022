### Short Biography
Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student and participant at the 2016 NEON Data Institute. <span style="color:green">__Forest ecology__</span> is my jam. Most of my current research looks at how organisms and ecosystems respond to stress, such as drought and air pollution. I'm also interested in what goes on in ecosystems after they endure such a disturbance. I work at the University of California Berkeley, and my field studies are in the Sierra Nevada range. My full bio is available [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceratops)
	+ NEON domains: __Pacific Southwest__, Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, Southern Rockies, Northeast

### Some Course Goals
* Practice and become more comfortable using version control with _collaborative_ work (there is not very much merging or forking when I'm working alone)
* Refresh my raster data chops and 
* Get to know what info is available from NEON

### Capstone Project
#####Questions I'm interested in addressing for the capstone project include:

* __How might we quantify uncertainties when using measurements of terrestrial vegetation (plots, LIDAR) to validate remotely sensed data?__
	+ _especially in forests_
	+ data required: 
		+ ground based LIDAR
		+ hyperspectral vegetation data 
		+ standardized forest structure measurements (DBH, height, maybe worked up to biomass)


* __How do CO2 fluxes change in relation to phenology, disturbance, and recovery processes?__
	+ also, _especially from forests_
	+ data required: 
		+ hyperspectral vegetation data
		+ ground based LIDAR
		+ standardized forest structure measurements (DBH, height, maybe worked up to biomass)
		+ (External) disturbance event information, such as drought, bark beetle attack, fires.
		+ fluxes for pre- and post- event,
		+ timing of phenology to extract related data 
	

* __Is there any data from Teakettle I can play with?__
    + This one is a personal interest (close to my research sites).
