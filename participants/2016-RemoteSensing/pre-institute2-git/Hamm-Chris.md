## Hi, my name is Chris Hamm

### I am an evolutionary ecologist that works with the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Evolutionary ecologist is code for "I do a lot of different things." 

Some random facts about me:

* I grew up in California
* I worked as a wildland firefighter and served in the Army
* Went to Michigan State University for grad school
* I enjoy beer and have been known to write beer inspired poetry in an attempt to win free beer (no verified video of this exists).
* I have a dog named Larry
* One goal I have for this course is to get comfortable finding geospatial data. 


## Capstone Project
### To be completely honest, I am still thinking about what I want  my *Capstone* project to be because I am not entirely sure there are enough vegetation data to do what I want, but here is what I am thinking:
How are estimates of plant beta diversity (species turnover) associated between the the aerial and ground truthed data?I want to do this with a metric called Jost' d, which is a numbers equivalent for the effective number of communities in a site. I suspect that different values of **q**, which changes the weighting given to rare species, will effect the ground truthed data more strongly than aerial data.
