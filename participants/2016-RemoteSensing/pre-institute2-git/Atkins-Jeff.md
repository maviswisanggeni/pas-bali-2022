I am a post-doc at Virginia Commonwealth University working in Chris Gough's lab where I am focusing on using portable canopy LiDAR in conjunction with NEON site data to answer the question of whether canopy structural complexity predicts net primary productivity across the continental United States. Through this course I hope to broaden my skills in using large datasets and collaborative software.

## Capstone Project

Connecting ground-based measurements to remotely sensed data products offers a powerful opportunity for scientists. I would like to explore relating ground based measures of canopy structural complexity and light use efficiency, to remotely sensed data gathered at NEON sites, with a focus on the Southeast and Appalachian regions as there are pre-existing AOP data for these areas that coincide with our collected data. 

The AOP data, likely the waveform LiDAR or hyperspectral, may be most useful to compare to our LiDAR data. Challenges would include coverage at the particular sites necessary to coincide with our data. Also, there are up to two or three years in data mismatch.
